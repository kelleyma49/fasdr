Fasdr (pronounced similar to "faster") is a command-line productivity booster for PowerShell.  It supports quick access to leaf and container classes for PowerShell providers.  Leaf and container paths are tracked and ranked based on frequency and date.

# Introduction
Fasdr allows you to open files or change directories by accessing its database that it keeps of your history.  `Set-Frecent` is used to jump between paths.  You can even use tab completion to iterate through Fasdr's database.  Here are some examples:

```powershell
  j 'Files'         # cd 'c:\Program Files'
  jl 'notepad.exe'  # cd 'c:\Windows\System32'
```
`j` is aliased to `Set-Frecent`, which accepts leaves and containers.  `jl` is aliased to `Set-FrecentFromLeaf`, which forwards to `Set-Frecent`; however, tab completion will filter only leaf paths.

# Installation
Fasdr is available on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Fasdr). Note that it will hook into the current prompt and tab completion functions for proper support of word completion mode.

Fasdr has only been tested on PowerShell 5.0.

# Matching
Fasdr has similar matching rules to [Fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd#matching).  Exact matches between the search string and the last element of items stored in the database are returned first, followed by fuzzy matches.

# Search Syntax
Fasdr's search syntax supports prefix, suffix, and current directory searches.

| Token Example | Match type                              | Description                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------  | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `log.txt`     | fuzzy match                             | Items that exactly match or fuzzy match `log.txt`    |
| `=log.txt`    | exact match                             | Items that exactly match `log.txt`                   | 
| `^notepad`    | prefix exact match                      | Items that start with `notepad`                      |
| `.cpp$`       | suffix exact match                      | Items that end with `.cpp`                           |
| `**Documents` | match against current working directory | Items that exist below the current working directory |

# Word Completion
Fasdr has special tokens that can be used for tab completion from any command.

| Token Example | Match type                              | Description                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------  | ----------------------------------- | 
| `:::Windows`  | containers and leaves                   | Items that contain Windows          |
| `c::Windows`  | containers only                         | Containers that contain  `Windows`  |
| `l::txt`      | leaves only                             | Leaves that contain `txt`           |
| `d::Windows`  | directories only                        | Directories that contain  `Windows` |
| `f::txt`      | files only                              | Files that contain `txt`            |


# Global Settings

Global settings can be set dynamically by accessing the global hashtable `$global:Fasdr`.

| Setting       | Description                                               | Default Value                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------  | ----------------------------------- | 
| `MaxResults`  | maximum results that `Find-Frecent` returns               | `50`                                |
| `MaxEntries`  | maximum number of entries saved in each provider database | `10000`                             |
